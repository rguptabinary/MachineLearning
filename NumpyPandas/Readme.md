# Notes

## Numpy
Numpy provides extension package for python for multidimensional array. It provides memory efficient containers (closer to hardware) for fast numeric computations.

```python
# Manyfold better time complexity than python lists
a = np.arrange(1000)
%timeit a**2
```

```python
# For help
np.array?
```
